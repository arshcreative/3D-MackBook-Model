# 3D MacBook Pro Model & Animation 🎬💻

This project showcases a fully modeled, textured, lit, and animated **3D MacBook Pro** created using **Blender**.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Blender 3.x
- Cycles Renderer (for realistic output)
- Photoshop *(optional – for texture refinement)*
- Adobe Premiere Pro *(optional – for final edit)*

## ✨ Features
- High-poly, dimensionally accurate 3D model
- Realistic lighting setup and material shaders
- Smooth animation with dynamic camera tracking
- Rendered in 1080p with compositing enhancements

## 🎯 Goals
- Practice full 3D asset pipeline
- Improve realism through lighting and texturing
- Create a presentable animation for portfolio use
